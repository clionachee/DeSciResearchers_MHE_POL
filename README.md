**Overview**

DeSci Researchers by Mental Health Engineering is a decentralized platform designed to bridge the gap between scientific researchers and the public. By leveraging blockchain technologies such as Polygon, Curvegrid, and Self Protocol, the platform enables researchers to mint their work as NFTs, providing transparent and immediate access to their findings. This approach addresses traditional challenges in research dissemination, including prolonged publication delays, data silos, and limited collaboration opportunities.

**Key Features**

- **NFT Minting for Research Outputs:** Researchers can tokenize their work as NFTs, ensuring provenance and facilitating direct engagement with the public.

- **3D Environment:** Making the environment to interact with researchers more immersive and fun.

- **Transparent Funding and Access:** NFTs allow for clear tracking of funding and access rights, ensuring that contributors and supporters can see how funds are utilized and access granted.

- **Enhanced Collaboration Opportunities:** Certain NFTs offer utilities such as one-on-one discussions with researchers, collaborative projects, or data-sharing opportunities, fostering a more interactive research environment.

- **AI Integration with Curvegrid:** The platform plans to integrate AI capabilities using Curvegrid, allowing users to query and interact with research outputs in intuitive ways.

**Monetization Strategy**

Moving away from traditional subscription or ad-based models, the platform focuses on:

- **Self Protocol:** Researchers canscan passport to verify real identity.

- **Asset Sales:** Beyond research papers, other assets like datasets, code, or methodologies can be sold directly to interested parties.

**Technical Implementation**

- **Blockchain Infrastructure:** Built on the Polygon network for scalability and low transaction costs.

- **Web3 Integration:** Utilizes Curvegrid's MultiBaas for seamless blockchain interactions and AI functionalities.

- **User Interface:** A Unity-based frontend may be developed to provide an immersive and user-friendly experience.

**Getting Started**

1. **Set Up a Wallet:** Users need a Web3-compatible wallet to interact with the platform.

2. **Mint or Purchase NFTs:** Researchers can mint their work as NFTs, while the public can purchase or access these NFTs to engage with the research.

3. **Engage with the Community:** Participate in discussions, collaborations, and data-sharing initiatives facilitated through the platform's features.
